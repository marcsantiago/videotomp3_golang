<p><b>Reason for creation:</b></p>
<p>
  I was tired of downloading mp3s from youtube on sites that allow you to input one link at a time.  
  By using youtube-dl and ffmpeg I was able to get around that.  
  The go program will download many mp3s in parallel.  The script checks to see how many cores you have and using a gorountine, downloads the mp3s.
</p>

<p><b>Installation:</b></p>
<p>
  The program is design to work on both macs and windows 64 bit.  
  The get started download the project and extract it's contents.  
  From your command line, type <code>go run setup.go</code>.  
  If you are a <b>mac user</b> the program will attempt to install homebrew, followed by the installtion of ffmpeg.  
  If the program fails try running these commands manually:
  <ol>
    <li><code>ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</code></li>
    <li><code>brew install ffmpeg --with-fdk-aac --with-ffplay --with-freetype --with-libass --with-libquvi --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opus --with-x265</code></li>
    <li><code>brew update && brew upgrade ffmpeg</code></li>
  </ol>
  If you are a <b>windows user</b> The program will attempt to create a folder in your c drive and copy the contents of the windows_ffmpeg folder to that new directory.  Afterwards it will create a path environment to the it's bin folder.
</p>
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<p>
  If you wish can can build the downloader using <code>go run downloader.go</code>, which will create a binary of the script
</p>
<p>
  If you are a windows user the program depends on the on the youtube-dl.exe being in the same directory as the downloader.go file or binary.
</p>
<p>
  If you are a mac user the program depends on the on the youtube-dl-master being in the same directory as the downloader.go file or binary.
</p>
<p>
  I suggest you create a shortcut or alias to the binary or go file.
</p>
<p><b>Setup Directory:</b></p>
<p>
  As a default mp3s are downloaded to the mp3_files directory located in the same directory as the downloader script.  
  To change the setting run:
  <code>go run downloader.go -c true</code>
  You will be prompted to enter the path to the directory you wish to dump the music to.
  That will create a config.txt file which contains the path to the directory, you can change the path by running the command again.
  The go program will attempt to create the directory if it doesn't already exist
</p>
<p><b>Known Windows Bug</b></p>
<p>
  The folder name you create must not have spaces in it, please use underscores otherwise the songs will not move to specified folder. They will just stay in the parent directory.  Correct --> /User/Desktop/my_mp3s Incorrect --> /User/Desktop/My Mp3
</p>

<p><b>Usage</b></p>
<p>
  To download mp3s use the command:
  <code>go run downloader.go -u [youtube url]</code>
  If you wish to downloader more then one mp3:
  <code>go run downloader.go -u [youtube url] -u [youtube url]..</code>
</p>
<p>
  You can also specify the path of a text document containing youtube urls that are newline deliminated:
  <code>go run downloader.go -f [PATH TO FILE]</code>
</p>
<p><b>Note</b></p>
<p>
  The program expects the youtube urls to be formatted as such: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek0SgwWmF9w
</p>

<p><b>Binaries</b></p>
<p>
  Mac and Windows binaries have been placed in there respected folders.  They were provided incase you did not have golang installed.  
  The Mac binary was compiled on 2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo proccesor.  
  The Windows binaries on windows 64bit.
  You can drag the binaries out and place it on the top level directory (same place as the downloader.go file).
  <b>Windows Note: </b>If you don't have golang installed drag the binaries out into the top level directory (same place as the downloader.go file).
</p>
<p>
  <b>Mac</b> Supplement command <code>go run downloader</code> with <code>./downloader</code>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Windwos</b> Supplement command <code>go run downloader</code> with <code>downloader.exe</code>
</p>
<p><b>Remember to run the setup file first</b></p>
